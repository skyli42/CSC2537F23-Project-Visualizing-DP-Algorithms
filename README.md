# Visualizing Differentially Private Algorithms

This repository contains the code used to create visualizations for Sky Li's research project for CSC2537 (Information Visualization) at the University of Toronto in Fall 2023. 

The project explored visualizations of differentially private algorithms.

These visualizations were compiled into pictures and animated gifs and were used for the project's user study, as well as the final report.
